 Class Scheduler Web Application

A web-based platform for automated class scheduling in higher education institutions. It allows authorized users to input classrooms, courses, teachers, and class groups, and generates an optimized, color-coded timetable. Teachers can also find available rooms for extra classes and suggest rescheduling options.

---

## Features
- Add and manage classrooms, courses, teachers, and class groups
- Assign one teacher per course per class group
- Generate a weekly timetable (8am–6pm, Mon–Fri) with no conflicts
- Color-coded, tabular timetable display for each class group
- Find available rooms for extra classes
- Suggest rescheduling options for classes
- Data stored in a local SQLite database
- **Modern GitHub-style dark UI** (deep black, purple accent, crisp layout)

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Flask (web framework)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Jinja2 (templating)
- HTML/CSS (GitHub-inspired dark theme)

## Getting Started
